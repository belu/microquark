# Data model

The data model is based on the referendums (Volksabstimmungen) in Switzerland.

Up to four times a year, the Swiss citizens have the opportunity to vote on several
submissions (Vorlagen). Switzerland has around 8.5 million inhabitants.

This gives a good playground to generate and query some data.
