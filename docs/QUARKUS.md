# Quarkus integration

## Features

* Configuration via `application.properties`
* Support for different storage targets:
  * in-memory
  * filesystem
  * JDBC (PostgreSQL, MariaDB)
  * MongoDB
* Health checks
  * [readiness](http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready)
  * [liveness](http://localhost:8080/q/health/live)

## Live-Reload & Hot-Deployment

Full support for Live-Reload and Hot-Deployment. Clean shutdown and re-opening of the
MicroStream storage.

## Testing

For testing you can use the supported in-memory filesystem. Every `QuarkusTest` is
will use the in-memory filesystem by default. This is configured in the file
`application.properties` under the test resources.

The in-memory filesystem is using [JimFS](https://github.com/google/jimfs/).

## Build & run

This is explained in the original [README.orig.md](README.orig.md) generated by Quarkus.
